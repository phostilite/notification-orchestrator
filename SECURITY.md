   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Use strong, unique values for secrets
   - Rotate secrets regularly

2. **Database Security**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Enable SSL connections
   - Regular backups
   - Limited access permissions

3. **API Security**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use HTTPS only
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Monitor API usage

4. **Infrastructure**
   - Regular security updates
   - Network isolation
   - Firewall configuration
   - Access logging

## 🔍 Security Checklist for Contributors

Before submitting pull requests, ensure:

- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Authentication checks in place
- [ ] Logging implemented correctly
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive info

## 📊 Known Security Considerations

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - API endpoints are rate-limited
   - Customizable limits per endpoint
   - Prevents brute force attacks

2. **Data Protection**
   - Sensitive data is encrypted at rest
   - PII is handled according to GDPR
   - Regular data cleanup procedures

3. **Authentication**
   - JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
   - Refresh token rotation
   - Failed login attempt monitoring

## 🔄 Regular Security Updates

We regularly review and update our security measures:

- 🔍 Monthly dependency audits
- 🛠️ Quarterly security reviews
- 📝 Regular penetration testing
- 🔄 Continuous monitoring
- 📊 Security patch management
